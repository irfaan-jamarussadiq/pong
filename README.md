# Pong
A game of Pong written in Python using object oriented design. Use the up and down arrows keys to move the player (left paddle) and 'a' and 'b' keys to move the opponent (right paddle). After either player has won 11 points, the game ends and the appropriate player wins. You can restart the game at that point.
